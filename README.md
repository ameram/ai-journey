# AI Journey
Bunch of notebooks made in Kaggle while I was studying the fast.ai course _Practical Deep Learning for Coders Pt. 1_ by Jeremy Howard.

These notebooks are:
* titanic-test-01: a model just by using machine learning and EDA for titanic dataset on kaggle.
* titanic-test-02: a deep learning model for titanic dataset.
* paddy-disease: notebook for a competition on kaggle with the same name.
* mental-health: EDA on mental health data {On Going}
* asl-fingerspelling-recognition: kaggle competition {On Going}
